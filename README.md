 2. The welcome message shows the status of the autoclicker.
 3. You get two buttons and you can also adjust the interval between which the autoclicker will click. The default is 120 seconds
 4. When you click Start, the app starts a background task called thread that clicks the mouse every 120 seconds by default and clicks again.
 5. When you click Stop, the app stops the background task.
